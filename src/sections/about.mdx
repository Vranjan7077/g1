## About

### Hi, I'm Vinay Ranjan, 

Final year postgrad pursuing engineering from JMI in Computer Science. I enjoy 
generating new ideas and devising feasible solutions to broadly relevant problems. My colleagues would 
describe me as a driven, resourceful individual who maintains a positive proactive attitude when faced with 
adversity. Currently, I am seeking for opportunities to enhance my skills.
"I aim to make a difference through my creative solutions."
